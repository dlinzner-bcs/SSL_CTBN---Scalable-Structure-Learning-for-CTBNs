# Introduction
This is the companion code to the paper 'Scalable Structure Learning for Continuous-time Bayesian Networks from Incomplete Data' [D.Linzner, M.Schmidt and H Koeppl].

Simulations similar to the ones used in the paper can be run with this Python code.

# Installation
The code has been tested on MacOs 10.14.5.
## Prerequisites
This code has been tested with Matlab 2018b


# Simulation
The simulation files can be found in the simulation folder. For creating plots the scripts in the evaluation folder can be used.
